## Project Description
My Project is mainly about descriping the mode of music that is mostly listened on spotify all over the world by two main variables which are the valence the song has and the arousal and see the differences.

## Questions & Hypotheses
My questions were if mostly listened music are happy ones?
If it is different what mode we like to listen to per year?

## Dataset
I used Data from kaggle.com

## Workflow
first my datasets were having the top 100 songs for 2017 ,2018 and 50 songs for 2019, with the arousal and valence level for each song, by making an algorithm to specify what does those two values tell me about the song i added the mode of the song to the data i have
after having the mode i could easily plot the data and see the differences.

## Organization
In my repository i have three folders one for data and one for images i used and one for the code, a read_me file and a gitignore file.
there is also a powerpoint presentation 
My code is seperated in three files one file for the top music for the three years
and one file for a random featured sample for about 230000 songs
and one file for the mental test made on random sample
and one file for all the function i used which is 'Classifications.py'
